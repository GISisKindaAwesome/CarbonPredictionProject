This streamlit is based on a project done in collaboration between Thijme Jonckers and Archipelagos Institute of Marine Conservation. 

All data provided is based on data collected from the Google Earth Engine catalog and field data gathered on the island of Samos by Thijme Jonckers and Archipelagos Institute of Marine Conservation.

For page 4 (4_Classification.py), the final classification map has a version which can be unmarked(#) if you want to run the streamlit locally. This way you get an interactive map. Since this doesn't work on the streamlit server the plot poses as an alternative.
